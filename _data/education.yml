    I used this master education to further develop my design competencies, placing particular emphasis on design/creative thinking and using synthesis skills throughout a product design process.
    My work extended from healthcare-oriented design projects towards designing for social ends, focusing on topics such as peopleâ€™s interrelations (e.g. group dynamics/sociology), positions in society (e.g. design for elderly) and the relationships they have with others within their social environment (e.g. design for empathy).

    The bachelor of Industrial Design was a project-based education, during which I acquired core industrial- and product design skills and competencies, and learned to integrate them into effective design processes suited to user context, requirements and specification.
    My design methodology developed towards a strong research-driven approach, with many projects in the area of user-system interaction. These projects had a broad range of themes and aims, though leaning towards healthcare- and comfort-oriented contexts during later stages of the education.
