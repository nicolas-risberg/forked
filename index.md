## Education

#### Masterclass Application Development
> Educom & Detacom ( _Sep 2015 — Dec 2015_ )

Studied application development methods & processes.
Core focus on Java (attained OCJA SE7 certification), PHP, MySQL (incl. cli), HTML, CSS.

#### Master Industrial Design
> Technical University of Eindhoven ( _2010 — 2013_ )

I used this master education to further develop my design competencies, placing particular emphasis on design/creative thinking and using synthesis skills throughout a product design process.

My work extended from healthcare-oriented design projects towards designing for social ends, focusing on topics such as people's interrelations (e.g. group dynamics/sociology), positions in society (e.g. design for elderly) and the relationships they have with others within their social environment (e.g. design for empathy).

#### Bachelor Industrial Design
> Technical University of Eindhoven ( _2007 — 2010_ )

The bachelor of Industrial Design was a project-based education, during which I acquired core industrial- and product design skills and competencies, and learned to integrate them into effective design processes suited to user context, requirements and specification.

My design methodology developed towards a strong research-driven approach, with many projects in the area of user-system interaction. These projects had a broad range of themes and aims, though leaning towards healthcare- and comfort-oriented contexts during later stages of the education.
