Hi there! I'm a Stockholm-based Front-End Developer / Engineer with a background in UX- and Interaction Design. Always eager to learn new ways of looking at life, the universe and everything, I take a strong user-centric and holistic approach to all things Front-End. I enjoy developing products for people by combining analytical and empathic angles — examining and immersing users’ perspectives — building and improve solutions that support them in their needs, goals and lives.

#### Core skill areas:
- Front-End Development & Engineering
- Interaction & UI Design
- User Experience & Testing
- Social Design
- Design for Healthcare & Well-Being
- Data Analysis (Qualitative & Quantitative)
